                        At Eguidance Labs, we recognize that privacy is an important issue, so
                        we always design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. 
                        This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal protection we assure when you use
                        Eguidance Labs’s services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it.
                        We do not rent or sell your personal identity information to other companies or individuals, unless we have your consent.
                        We may share such information in any of the following limited circumstances: We have your consent.
                        We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of
                         processing personally identifying information on our behalf.
                        When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process such information only on our instructions and
                        in compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
                        We conclude that we are required by law or have a good faith belief that access, 
                        preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, 
                        property or safety of Eguidance Lab’s, its users or the public.
